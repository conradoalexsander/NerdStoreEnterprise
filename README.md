# NerdStoreEnterprise

This is the Nerd Store Enterprise Application being developed during a course from [desenvolvedor.io](https://desenvolvedor.io/curso-online-asp-net-core-enterprise-applications). 

It is a case of study about an enterprise application, majorly focused dive in concepts like scalability and reliability. Therefore, a distributed API architecture that applies some concepts of Microservices and DDD are explored. Technologies such as Message Broker (RabbitMQ), Containers (Docker), load balancers (NGINX), etc. are used.

I am doing this version in .NET 5. Further improvements and ideas to the project are planned. I will update this README as soon as I figure it out.
